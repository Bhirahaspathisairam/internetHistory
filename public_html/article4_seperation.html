                    <p>
                        A key principle of software development and architecture is the notion of separation of
                        concerns. At a low level,
                        this principle is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle of object oriented
                        programming. The general idea is that one should avoid co-locating different concerns within the
                        design or code. For instance, if your application includes business logic for identifying
                        certain noteworthy items to display to the user, and your application formats such items in a
                        certain way to make them more noticeable, it would violate separation of concerns if both the
                        logic for determining which items were noteworthy and the formatting of these items were in the
                        same place. The design would be more maintainable, less tightly coupled, and less likely to
                        violate the Don't Repeat Yourself principle if the logic for determining which items needed
                        formatted were located in a single location (with other business logic), and were exposed to the
                        user interface code responsible for formatting simply as a property.
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Separation of Concerns tends to be a natural consequence of following the Don't Repeat
                            Yourself
                            principle, since of necessity abstractions must be built to encapsulate concepts that would
                            otherwise be repeated throughout the application. As long as these abstractions are
                            logically
                            grouped and organized, then Separation of Concerns should be achieved.

                        <p>
                            The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle states that duplication in logic should be
                            eliminated via abstraction; duplication in process should be eliminated via automation.
                            Duplication is Waste. Adding additional, unnecessary code to a codebase increases the amount
                            of work required to extend and maintain the software in the future. Duplicate code adds to
                            technical debt. Whether the duplication stems from Copy Paste Programming or poor
                            understanding of how to apply abstraction, it decreases the quality of the code. Duplication
                            in process is also waste if it can be automated. Manual testing, manual build and
                            integration processes, etc. should all be eliminated whenever possible through the use of
                            automation.

                                In the calculator program the methods are defined properly and the logic is seperated
                                and written in different method inorder to maintain the DRY principle.
                                Consider the Below image:
                            </p>

                                method. Thus Achieving the Seperation of concern and DRY Principle.
                                The method holding the business logic is listed below

                                The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one
                                reason to change. So if a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled. A
                                change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility.

                                functions. The classes that make use of User properties will have to be touched and
                                recompiled to compensate for the new changes. It’s like a domino effect, touch one card
                                it affects all other cards in line.

                                So we simply split the class, we create another class that will handle the one
                                responsibility of storing an user to a database

                            <p>
                                The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules,
                                methods, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

                                In practice, this means creating software entities whose behavior can be changed without
                                the need to edit and recompile the code itself. The simplest way to demonstrate this
                                principle is to consider a method that does one thing. Let's say it writes to a
                                particular file, the name of which is hard-coded into the method. If the requirements
                                change, and the filename now needs to be different in certain situations, we must open
                                up the method to change the filename. If, on the other hand, the filename had been
                                passed in as a parameter, we would be able to modify the behavior of this method without
                                changing its source, keeping it closed to modification.
